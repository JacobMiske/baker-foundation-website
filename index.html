					<p>The late Dean Baker was known throughout the country as an outstanding educator, administrator and theologian. He had attained wide recognition in recent years as a speaker at student conferences and institutes. In August he had flown to Bombay, India, to address the annual conference of the International Student Service of which he was chairman. This organization with the cooperation of the American World Student Service Fund was instrumental in bringing foreign students to the United States for study in American institutions of higher learning.
					</p>
					<p>Dr. Baker had always maintained a keen interest in the activities of young people. His own interest in outdoor activities and sports led to his association with boys' camps early in his career, a field in which he remained active until his death.
					</p>
					<p>A graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy, and Dartmouth College, class of 1924, Dean Baker undertook graduate work at the Harvard Divinity School, completing his studies there in 1929. In 1937, he was elected Vice President of the American Unitarian Association, following a period of active church work throughout New England. In addition to general administrative work, he directed the publishing business of the Unitarian denomination and its fund raising campaign.
					</p>
					<p>Before coming to the Institute in 1947, Dean Baker served as minister of the First Unitarian Church of Cleveland, Ohio. In Cleveland he acted as Chairman of the Unitarian War Service Council under whose auspices he edited and published a book of readings for men and women in the service entitled "Think on These Things." Over three million copies of the book were distributed to men and women in the armed forces. Dr. Baker was president of the Unitarian Ministerial Union from 1944 to 1949, and had been a member of the board of directors of the American Unitarian Association for several years. In 1948 he was elected to a one-year term as president of the Dartmouth Alumni Association.
					</p>
					<p>Under Dean Baker's guidance the Office of the Dean of Students expanded its authority and responsibility in all aspects of student welfare. Both the athletic program and the system of student government received special attention and attained their proper place in the undergraduate program.
